    <p>Spaghetti and Meatballs in homemade marinara sauce. These are amazing “WOW”-inducing MEATBALLS – so tasty and juicy and BIG! We’re sharing all of our secrets for incredibly tender and flavorful meatballs.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients for Meatballs (makes 22-23 meatballs): </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>White bread is best but you can use whole wheat or other soft sliced bread</li>
        <li>Use lean ground beef - 7% to 15% fat content</li>
        <li>If you aren't able to find Italian sausage meat only, use sausages and remove casings</li>
        <li>Use freshly grated parmesan or finely shredded pre-packaged</li>
        <li>Do not skimp on the garlic in the meatballs or the sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Ingredients for Marinara Sauce: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>It seems alot of chopped yellow onion but it shrinks considerably</li>
        <li>If you use "Crushed tomatoes with basil" you can omit the fresh basil if desired</li>
        <li>Bay leaves are nice, but optional if you don't have them on hand</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps on how to Make the Best Italian Meatballs: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine diced crustless bread pieces with 2/3 cup water and set aside for 5 minutes then mash together with a fork.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl (I use my KitchenAid mixer to do the work), add: 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb sausage, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 4 minced garlic cloves, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 egg and the mashed moist bread crumbs. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Form into 1 1/2″ meatballs (about a flat ice cream scoop's worth of meat). Dredge/roll meatballs in flour. Heat a deep, large, heavy skillet or a Dutch oven over medium heat with about 3 Tbsp oil. Add meatballs in batches so you don’t crowd the pan and saute until browned on all sides (6 min total or 2 min per side). Remove meatballs to a separate dish and set aside (don’t worry about cooking through at this point).</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>How to Make Marinara Sauce: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In the same skillet over medium heat, add more oil if needed and saute 1 cup chopped onion stirring often until soft and golden (5 min). Add 4 cloves minced garlic and stir 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in 2 cans of crushed tomatoes and 2 bay leaves. Bring to a light boil (stir to make sure it’s actually boiling and hot and not just letting bubbles to the surface).</li>
        <li>Add meatballs back into the pan with tomato sauce, partially cover and cook at a gentle simmer for 30 min, turning the meatballs occasionally. Meatballs will be tender and sauce will be thickened. 5 minutes before your sauce is done, stir in chopped fresh basil and add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Finishing Details: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta according to package instructions until aldente or softer if your family loves it that way! Truth be told, I love slightly overcooked pasta. Drain pasta and return to the empty pot.</li>
        <li>Pour sauce and meatballs over spaghetti and toss gently to combine. To serve family-style, transfer to a large platter, garnish with more parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves if desired and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
